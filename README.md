# Global Tech Layoff Post-Pandemic Analysis

## Project Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly changed customer demand, especially with a shift toward remote work and digital services.

The goal is to provide HR department leaders and business leaders with data-driven insights into workforce planning and investment to emerging and resilient sectors and help them mitigate risks in future economic uncertainties.
