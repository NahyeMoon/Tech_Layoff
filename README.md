### Impact of Pandemic and Post-Pandemic Trends on Industry Layoffs (2020-2024)
<ul style="list-style-type: circle; font-weight: light;">
<li>
  <strong>General Trends</strong>: <br/>
  <em><strong>Layoffs</em></strong> across industries <em><strong>increased</em></strong> due to the combined effects of <em><strong>automation, e-commerce growth, inflation,</em></strong> and ongoing <em>      <strong>economic challenges</em></strong>. The significantly low number of layoffs in 2021 is discussed in more detail in the assumptions section.

  <br/>
    
  <li>
  <strong>Transportation</strong>: <br/>
  <em><strong>13,600</em></strong> layoffs in <em><strong>2020</em></strong> were driven by <em><strong>travel restrictions</em></strong>, with the number remaining significant in <em><strong>2024 (4,638 as of June 28th)</em></strong>  due to economic <em><strong>challenges</em></strong> and <em><strong>labor shortages</em></strong>.
  </li>
  <br/>

  <br/>
  
  <li>
  <strong>Consumer</strong>: <br/>
  The layoffs in <em><strong>Consumer</em></strong> starting at <em><strong>5,341</em></strong> in <em><strong>2020</em></strong>, surged to <em><strong>27,110</em></strong> in <em><strong>2023</em></strong>, reflecting continued <em><strong>shifts in consumer spending, inflation</em></strong>, and <em><strong>economic downturns</em></strong> that impacted the industry over the years.

### Emerging Industries with Minimal Layoffs (2024)
<ul style="list-style-type: circle; font-weight: light;">
 <li>
  <strong>General Trends</strong>: <br/>
   The industries with the lowest number of layoffs, including <em><strong>Insurance, Biotechnology Research, SaaS, Fintech</em></strong>, and <em><strong>Translation</em></strong> showed records <em><strong>only in 2024</em></strong>, indicating their <em><strong>emergence</em></strong> and <em><strong>growth</em></strong> with small number of layoffs.
  </li>
  <br/>
  
  <li>
  <strong>Insurance</strong> and <strong>Biotechnology Research</strong>: Both industries showed low number of layoffs layoffs (<em><strong>135</em></strong> and <em><strong>184</em></strong>, respectively), driven by <em><strong>steady demand</em></strong> for <em><strong>risk management</em></strong> and growing investments in <em><strong>healthcare innovation</em></strong> during and after the pandemic.
    </li>
  <br/>

  <li>
<strong>SaaS</strong> and <strong>Fintech</strong>: With the rapid <em><strong>digital transformation</em></strong> since pandemic, <em><strong>SaaS (45 layoffs)</em></strong> and <em><strong>Fintech (190)</em></strong> thrived with increased adoption of remote work, digital banking, and financial innovations, reflecting their emergence as <em><strong>high-growth sectors</em></strong>.
    </li>
  <br/>

  <li>
<strong>Translation and Localization</strong>: With only <em><strong>160</em></strong> layoffs recorded in <em><strong>2024</em></strong>, this sector benefited from globalization and the growing demand for <em><strong>cross-border communication</em></strong> in the <em><strong>post-pandemic</em></strong> world.
    </li>

  The 5,900 recorded layoffs from Microsoft and 6,000 from Dell in 2024 (as of June 28th) reflect workforce adjustments as both companies pivot toward cloud computing and enterprise solutions, responding to a decline in PC demand and slower growth in traditional software products post-pandemic.
  <br/>
  </ul>

### Regional and Company-Specific Layoff Trends (2020-2024)
<ul style="list-style-type: circle; font-weight: light;">
  
<li>
The <em><strong>bubble map</em></strong> shows that layoffs were <em><strong>concentrated</em></strong> in the <em><strong>USA</em></strong>. The <em><strong>tables</em></strong> shows that <em><strong>companies</em></strong> in the <em><strong>USA</em></strong> led the <em><strong>top layoffs</em></strong> each year, with examples like <em><strong>Uber</em></strong> in <em><strong>2020 (6,700)</em></strong>, <em><strong>Meta</em></strong> in <em><strong>2022 (11,000)</em></strong>, and <em><strong>Tesla</em></strong> in <em><strong>2024 (20,020)</em></strong>, contributing to the <em><strong>73%</em></strong> of <em><strong>total layoffs</em></strong> recorded in the dataset being from the <em><strong>USA</em></strong>.
</li>
<br/>

<li>
Layoffs at <em><strong>Uber (6,700)</em></strong>, <em><strong>Groupon (2,800)</em></strong>, and <em><strong>Airbnb (1,900)</em></strong> in <em><strong>2020</em></strong> highlight the severe impact of the pandemic on Transportation, Retail, and Travel industries due to travel restrictions and reduced consumer spending.
</li>
<br/>

<li>
<em><strong>Google (12,000 in 2023, ranked 2nd)</em></strong> and <em><strong>Meta (11,000 in 2022, ranked 1st; 10,000 in 2023, ranked 3rd)</em></strong> laid off thousands of employees as the <em><strong>demand for online services</em></strong> that spiked during the pandemic <em><strong>leveled off by 2022 and 2023</em></strong>.
</li>
<br/>

<li>
<em><strong>Amazon (17,000 in 2023, ranked 1st; 10,150 in 2022, ranked 2nd)</em></strong> hired extensively during the early stages of the pandemic to meet the surge in online shopping demand but significantly <em><strong>reduced</em></strong> its workforce by <em><strong>2022</em></strong> as the <em><strong>demand</em></strong> began to <em><strong>level off</em></strong>.
</li>
<br/>

<li>
Layoffs at <em><strong>Microsoft (10,000 in 2023)</em></strong> and <em><strong>Dell (6,000 in 2024)</em></strong> reflect workforce adjustments in response to a <em><strong>decline</em></strong> in <em><strong>PC demand</em></strong> and slower growth in <em><strong>traditional software products</em></strong> post-pandemic.
