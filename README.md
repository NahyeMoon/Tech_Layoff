# Global Tech Layoff Post-Pandemic Analysis

## Project Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly changed customer demand, especially with a shift toward remote work and digital services. This project aims to understand how the pandemic affected different sectors of tech and how tech companies restructured their workforces during and after the pandemic in response to these shifts and subsequent economic stabilization. The goal is to provide HR department leaders and business leaders with data-driven insights into workforce planning and investment to emerging and resilient sectors and help them mitigate risks in future economic uncertainties.

## Executive Summary

## Insight Deep Dive
### Layoff Trends for Top 5 Industries with the most total layoffs

  
<ul style="list-style-type: circle; font-weight: light;">
  <li>
  <strong>2020</strong>: <br/>
  <strong><em>Transportation</strong></em> had the highest layoffs <strong><em>(13,600)</strong></em> due to <strong><em>travel restrictions</strong></em>. Other industries, such as <strong><em>Retail (7,615),      Finance (5,714), Food (5,629), and Consumer (5,341), were also impacted by store closures, hospitality shutdowns, and the economic downturn.

    
  </li>
  <br/>
  
  <li>
  <strong>2021</strong>: <br/>
  The highest number of layoffs in <strong><em>Real Estate (2,900)</strong></em> and <strong><em>Construction (2,434)</strong></em> reflect the pandemic's impact on the housing market, driven by reduced             office demand, disrupted supply chains, and regional lockdowns slowing construction. The comparatively low number of layoffs in other industries in 2021 is likely due to data bias, which will be discussed         further in the assumptions section.

  <li>
  <strong>2022</strong>: <br/>
  The layoffs in <strong><em>Retail (18,528)</strong></em> increased by <strong><em>140%</strong></em> compared to 2020, likely due to the shift to <strong><em>e-commerce</em></strong> and disrupted supply          chains. In <strong><em>Finance (10,663)</strong></em>, the introduction of <strong><em>machine learning and automation</strong></em> may have contributed to the 87% increase in layoffs.
