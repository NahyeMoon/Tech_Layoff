# Global Tech Layoff Post-Pandemic Analysis

## Project Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly changed customer demand, especially with a shift toward remote work and digital services. This project aims to understand how the pandemic affected different sectors of tech and how tech companies restructured their workforces during and after the pandemic in response to these shifts and subsequent economic stabilization. The goal is to provide HR department leaders and business leaders with data-driven insights into workforce planning and investment to emerging and resilient sectors and help them mitigate risks in future economic uncertainties.

<ul style="list-style-type: circle; font-weight: light;">
  <li>
  <strong>2020</strong>: <br/>
  <strong><em>Transportation</strong></em> had the highest layoffs <strong><em>(13,600)</strong></em> due to <strong><em>travel restrictions</strong></em>. Other industries, such as <strong><em>Retail (7,615),      Finance (5,714), Food (5,629), and Consumer (5,341)</strong></em> were also impacted by store closures, hospitality shutdowns, and the economic downturn.

    
  </li>
  <br/>
  
  <li>
  <strong>2021</strong>: <br/>
  <strong><em>Real Estate (2,900)</strong></em> and <strong><em>Construction (2,434)</strong></em> saw the highest layoffs due to <strong><em>reduced office demand</em></strong> and disrupted supply chains in       construction. The low layoffs in other sectors likely stem from data bias, which will be discussed in the assumptions section.
  </li>
  <br/>
  
  <li>
  <strong>2022</strong>: <br/>
  The layoffs in <strong><em>Retail (18,528)</strong></em> increased by <strong><em>140%</strong></em> compared to 2020, likely due to the shift to <strong><em>e-commerce</em></strong> and disrupted supply          chains. In <strong><em>Finance (10,663)</strong></em>, the introduction of <strong><em>machine learning and automation</strong></em> may have contributed to the <strong><em>87%</strong></em> increase in           layoffs.
  </li>
  <br/>  
  

  </li>
  <strong>2023</strong>: <br/>
  The layoffs in <strong><em>Consumer (27,110)</strong></em> surged significantly, reflecting changes in consumer spending habits and <strong><em>restructuring</strong></em> in the sector due to <strong>            <em>inflationa and economic downturns</strong></em>. <strong><em>Retail (25,535)</strong></em> layoffs also remained high, likely driven by continued growth in <strong><em>e-commerce</strong></em> and shifts      in shopping behaviors.
