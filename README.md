# Global Tech Layoff Post-Pandemic Analysis

## Project Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly changed customer demand, especially with a shift toward remote work and digital services. This project aims to understand how the pandemic affected different sectors of tech and how tech companies restructured their workforces during and after the pandemic in response to these shifts and subsequent economic stabilization. The goal is to provide HR department leaders and business leaders with data-driven insights into workforce planning and investment to emerging and resilient sectors and help them mitigate risks in future economic uncertainties.

  <strong>2020</strong>: <br/>
  The <em><strong>transportation</strong></em> industry saw the <strong>highest number of layoffs, with approximately <em><strong>13,600 positions</strong></em> affected due to <em><strong>travel 
  restrictions</strong></em>. Other industries, such as retail (7,615 layoffs), finance (5,714), food (5,629), consumer (5,341) were also impacted but to a lesser extent, as store closures, hospitality shutdowns, 
  and the economic downturn took their toll.

  <br/>
  
  <li>
  <strong>2021</strong>: <br/>
  The highest number of layoffs in the real estate and construction industries, 2,900 and 2,434 respectively, reflects the pandemic's impact on the housing market, driven by reduced office demand, disrupted   
  supply chains and regional lockdowns slowing construction</li>

  <li>
  <strong>2021</strong>: <br/>
  The increased layoffs in retail (18,528) and by 140% compared to 2020 is likely to be due to the shift to E-commerce, and the introduction of machine learning and automation to finance may contributed to the 
  increase in layoff by 87% in finance (10,663).
